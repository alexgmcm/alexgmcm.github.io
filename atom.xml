<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://alexgmcm.github.io/about">About page</a> the name of the blog comes from a passage in <em>The Sign of the Four</em> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</strong> <cite>The Sign of the Four (1890)</cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>Sherlock Holmes is referring to Winwood Reade&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Winwood_Reade#The_Martyrdom_of_Man_.281872.29"><em>The Martyrdom of Man</em></a>. Apparently it was one of the most prominent books of the day -  offering a secular, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought">Freethinking</a> perspective on history.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.exclassics.com/martyrdom/mrtintro.htm">full text</a> is freely available at the wonderful <a href="http://www.exclassics.com/">exclassics.com</a> along with other forgotten relics such as:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.exclassics.com/espoke/espkint.htm"><em>English as She is Spoke</em>, by Pedro Carolino and Jose da Fonseca</a> - a Portuguese/English phrase book written by authors who knew no English and thus constructed the book by taking a Portuguese/French phrasebook and translating the French word for word into English using a dictionary. 
What could possibly go wrong? Well, here&#39;s an example:
<blockquote><p><strong>Very dissatisfied customer (brandishing pistol):</strong> Here is a horse who have a bad looks. Give me another; I will not that. He not sall know to march, he is pursy, he is foundered. Don&#39;t you are ashamed to give me a jade as like? he is undshoed, he is with nails up; it want to lead to the farrier.</p><p><strong>Terrified horse dealer:</strong> Your pistols are its loads?</p></blockquote>
One can only presume they went on to produce a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Hungarian_Phrasebook">Hungarian phrasebook</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us">translate video games</a>.</p></li>

She also makes the rather unlikely claim that:
<blockquote><p>The shepherds of Egypt had a singular manner of cooking eggs without the aid of fire. They placed them in a sling, which they turned so rapidly that the friction of the air heated them to the exact point required for use.</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I&#39;ll make a post calculating just how fast one would have to spin the sling&#8230;</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.</p><footer><strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong></footer></blockquote>

<p>I recently discovered a neat problem while looking at job applications. From the <a href="http://sparx.co.uk/deck/fiendish/5.asp">Sparx Deck</a>, the problem is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>A basketball player decides to spend an afternoon practicing free throws and recording her performance. Over the first hour, her scoring percentage is less than 75%, but by the end of the session, her overall scoring percentage for the day is more than 75%. Is it necessarily true that at some moment during the session her scoring percentage was exactly 75%?</p></blockquote>

<p>The answer to the above problem is <strong>yes</strong>. This may seem counter-intuitive but the reasoning will soon become clear as I was interested in solving the extension:
<blockquote><p>Extension: How special is the choice of 75% in this question? Does the same result hold for other percentages?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>So let us restate the general problem:</p>

<blockquote><p>A basketball player decides to spend an afternoon practicing free throws and recording her performance. Over the first hour, her scoring percentage is less than p%, but by the end of the session, her overall scoring percentage for the day is more than p%. Is it necessarily true that at some moment during the session her scoring percentage was exactly p%?</p></blockquote>

<p>To do this we will prove that the alternative, that the percentage can skip over <em>p</em>%, must be false for some values of <em>p</em> and we will then investigate what decides these values.</p>

<p>First let us express the percentage as a fraction \(p=\frac{a}{b} \times 100\) subject to the constraint \(a&lt;b\) as it is impossible for the scoring percentage to exceed 100%.</p>

<p>If we assume that it is possible to skip over <em>p</em> then there must be some point where the current percentage is less than <em>p</em> but by scoring just one more basket it will exceed <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>If we let <em>B</em> be the number of baskets scored and <em>N</em> be the total number of shots attempted then we can express these requirements as:</p>

<p>\[ \frac{B}{N}&lt;\frac{a}{b} \quad \mathsf{ and } \quad \frac{B+1}{N+1}&gt;\frac{a}{b} \]</p>

<p>These can be re-arranged to give:
\[ bB &lt; aN \]
\[ b(B+1) &gt; a(N+1)  \]</p>

<p>The latter of which can be rearranged to:
 \[bB &gt;aN + a - b\]</p>

<p>Remember we have the constraint that \(a&lt;b\), hence:
 \[aN+a-b &lt; aN\]</p>

<p>Therefore we require that:</p>

<p>\[ aN+a-b &lt; bB &lt; aN\]</p>

<p>As we also require that <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>N</em> are all integers then clearly this can only be satisfied when:
\[ a-b &lt; -1 \]</p>

<p>In any case that \(a-b = -1 \) the scoring percentage will always pass through <em>p</em> if it starts below it and ends up exceeding it.</p>

<p>For example this is the case for \(p=75\%\) as \(a=3\) and \(b=4\) but it is not the case for \(p=60\%\) where \(a=3\) and \(b=5\).</p>

<p>Now we can see why it must pass through 75% and have determined the other percentages for which this condition holds.</p>
